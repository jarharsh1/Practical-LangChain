Through various global examples, Tim Marshall challenges the widely held belief that technology is allowing humans to overcome the constraints and vulnerabilities imposed by geography and to render it irrelevant to geopolitics and conflicts. Marshall makes the case for putting the ‘geo’ back in ‘geopolitics’, arguing that geography often gets written out of discussions and analyses of historic and contemporary conflicts and stories of state development.\\nPrisoners of Geography covers the geopolitical situations in several vital regions of the world, including: Russia, China, the United States, Europe, the Arab World, South Asia (mainly focusing on the geopolitical anomalies of India and Pakistan), Africa, Japan and Korea, Latin America, and the Arctic Ocean (the latter mainly to focus on the geopolitics of the Arctic resources race).\\nPrisoners of Geography describes the impact geography can have on international affairs, offering an explanation for such geopolitical events as Russia\\'s annexation of Crimea (based on Russia\\'s need to retain access to warm-water ports) and China\\'s actions in Tibet (based on its interest in enforcing its border with India).\\nInformed by his first-hand experiences of conflict in areas from the Balkans to Syria, Tim Marshall explores how a better understanding of geography is crucial if we are to fully understand the past, present and future behaviours of nation states. Prisoners of Geography, through examples such as Russia and the Arctic, explores how geography is a deciding factor in processes of peace as well as war, analysing the ways in which an abundance or lack of resources can simultaneously stimulate and constrain states’ economic development.\\nThe author uses the example of the Middle East, specifically Syria, to demonstrate just how harmful and disastrous Western misunderstandings of topography can be. The author describes how these instances of geographical ignorance as well as an over-reliance on technology can play a decisive role in the outcome of conflicts.\\nIn his conclusion, the author reiterates the importance of geography and the central role that an understanding of physical landscape must have if we are to understand future conflict, particularly since he believes technology will see conflicts advancing into space as claims are made over yet-unclaimed areas.\\n\\n\\n== Reception ==\\nThe book was a New York Times Best Seller and #1 Sunday Times bestseller.\\nWriting in the American Association of Geographers\\' Review of Books, Douglas Webster concluded \"The book has obvious appeal, though, corroborated by its success to date, as an easy-to-read, informative primer on contemporary geographic dynamics from a geopolitical perspective.\" while noting that it would be criticised by exponents of global studies, who see more influence by sociological than geographical factors.\\nThe Berlin geographer Hans-Dietrich Schultz criticises that Prisoners of Geography is based on old-geographical spatial arguments of 19th-century regional geography, which completely contradict the current state of geographical research.

Although the Kashmir conflict was the predominant issue dividing the nations, other border disputes existed, most notably over the Rann of Kutch, a barren region in the Indian state of Gujarat. The issue first arose in 1956, which ended with India regaining control over the disputed area. In the 1960s Pakistan received 700 million dollars of military aid from the United States, by signing a defence agreement in 1954, which significantly modernised Pakistan's military equipment. After the defeat in 1962 Sino-Indian War, the Indian military was undergoing major changes in personnel and equipment. During this period, despite being numerically smaller than the Indian military, Pakistan's armed forces had a qualitative edge in air power and armour over India, which Pakistan sought to use before India completed its defence build-up.\\n\\nPakistani soldiers began patrolling in territory controlled by India in January 1965, which was followed by attacks by both countries on each other's posts on 8 April 1965. Initially involving border police from both nations, the disputed area soon witnessed intermittent skirmishes between the countries' armed forces. Pakistan launched Operation Desert Hawk and captured a few Indian posts near the Kanjarkot fort border area. In June 1965, British Prime Minister Harold Wilson successfully persuaded both countries to end hostilities. Both countries signed an agreement to settle the disputed border through international arbitration by the International Court of Justice on 30 June 1965. A tribunal was set to resolve the dispute, the verdict which came later in 1968, saw Pakistan awarded 780 square kilometres (301 square miles) of the Rann of Kutch, as against its original claim of 9,100 km2 (3,500 sq mi).
